# RGBLedController
This is for a simple RGB Strip LED Controller and written for an Arduino Uno.

The wiring diagram can be found at http://fritzing.org/projects/ledcontroller. 

This was written for FRC Team 1991 (team1991.com) to run the LEDs on the Driver Control Panel. 

A more updated version coming soon with individually adressable LED support as well as different selectable profiles.
